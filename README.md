# IT Logging Application

This is a demo project designed to expand my familiarity with react-redux and utilizing redux for application-level state management.

### To Run

    git clone git@github.com:AndrewKepson/logging-application-react-redux.git

    npm install

Command npm run dev activates concurrent scripts to run db.json as server, and React on localhost:4000.
